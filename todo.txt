multiBaseCalc
- entering numbers in any base (2-36)
- displaying numbers in any base
- converting between bases
- performing calculations, with fractional part
- operations: + - * / sqrt
- editing entered number (backspace)
- calculations like simple calculator, no fancy memory, history

todo:
//- converting between bases

//- ignore 0 at the beginning
//- detecting infinity, div/0
//- buttons for specific bases, 16, 10, 8, 2
//- add buttons to GUI?
//- handle truncating in view
    //- limit max number of digits? different bases have different number of digits
    //- limit max value?
    //- add ellipsis? reducing font size?
//- add internal state indicators? or in debug only?

- idea: button for entering edit mode when in result mode

- float inaccuracy visible on higher bases
//- 123 * PI is not intuitive
//- operations to add: 1/x, x^2, x^y, yroot(x), log10(x), ln(x), logy(x), sin, cos, tan, cot, (, ), e^x, +/-
//- FIXME log10(negative) does nothing
//- logy(x) i yroot(x), check domain and correctness of my calculation
//- tests of new operations
- copy / paste

//- parens and base changning?
//bug: paste too large number
